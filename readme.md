## How we built it üîß

‚û°Ô∏è Angular for the frontend along with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap

‚û°Ô∏è API for fetching the trending data across all platforms

Our Content Creators productivity tool is based on a state-of-the-art technology stack that is focused on enhancing reach to more and more audience. To develop and test our code in real-time, we utilized Replit, a collaborative coding platform that is interactive and user-friendly.

To ensure smooth communication among team members, we employed Discord, a powerful messaging and voice chat app that facilitated team discussions and provided regular updates on project progress.

To manage code changes effectively, we relied on GitHub as our primary version control system. This allowed us to work collaboratively with other developers, review code changes, and ensure that all updates were properly documented and tested before being deployed.

By harnessing the capabilities of these cutting-edge tools and technologies, we created an engineer productivity tool that is dependable, effective, and capable of helping engineers enhance their workflows, boost productivity, and deliver outstanding results.

## üöÄ How we have used Github in our project? üöÄ

We used Github in different ways:

Pull Requests and Issues: We created pull requests on our GitHub repository as we were a team of three and we're working on our local repository. If any of our team members gets an idea for a new feature, she would suggest it for all members to see and receive their opinions on how to implement it.

Github Branches Github branches helped a lot for beta testing of updated code before merging the new code into the original code. Our team approximately created 2-3 branches during the hackathon.

Github Pages we deployed our website at ========== using Github pages. It was really simple to deploy our site through GitHub pages and we are planning to use this feature in future hackathons.

Github Templates We used the Github default LICENSE template for adding an MIT license to our project.

Github Actions Although implementing the actions was a kind of hectic task for our team but we tried to implement them for our pull requests. We still had to learn about GitHub's actions for future hackathons.

## Challenges we ran into üôÅ

Our productivity tool for Content Creators is built using cutting-edge technology aimed at expanding our audience's reach. As a remote team, we encountered several obstacles that made collaboration and communication challenging at times. Nevertheless, we successfully tackled these obstacles by utilizing the right tools and technologies.

Another obstacle we encountered was collaborating through GitHub. Working with a distributed team meant that we had to be diligent in keeping our codebase updated while being careful not to overwrite each other's changes. However, we used GitHub's powerful version control features to ensure that all modifications were thoroughly documented and tested before merging.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of üòá

Our team is extremely proud of the achievements we've made with our engineer productivity tool. One noteworthy accomplishment is completing the project within a tight 24-hour deadline.

Despite the limited timeframe, we utilized our knowledge and experience to construct a robust and efficient tool that can assist engineers in enhancing their productivity. Our team worked tirelessly throughout the project, incorporating the latest technologies and adhering to best practices to ensure the tool's reliability, scalability, and user-friendliness.

Overall, we are pleased with what we accomplished in just 24 hours, and we believe that our engineer productivity tool demonstrates the talent, creativity, and hard work of our team.

## What we learned ü§î

During our learning process, we gained insights into the difficulties encountered by inexperienced content creators. Additionally, we acquired knowledge about various technologies such as Angular, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API's for retrieving trending data.
